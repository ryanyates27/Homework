1) 
# of runs	Theory 1	Theory 2	Theory 3
1-20	    2nd run	    17th run	8th run
1-20	    9th run	    1st run	    N/A
1-20	    N/A	        12th run	N/A
1-20	    16th run	5th run	    5th run
1-20	    N/A	        1st run	    15th run

2) Good: Our strategy allows us to check each theory multiple times on multiple runs to compare with other theories/runs in each theory.
   Bad: takes a long time to run each theory through the program with so many runs being needed.
